# Odds Converter Pro – Your Pocket Bookie 🎰

A ridiculously fun, lightning-fast React + Vite app that converts American odds ↔ Decimal odds, saves your bets, lets you name them like a boss, and even edit them inline like a pro.  
Because who has time for spreadsheets when you’re busy getting rich?

## Features That Slap

- Real-time American ↔ Decimal odds conversion (no refresh, no mercy)
- Save unlimited bets with unique IDs (because index-based deletion is for amateurs)
- Inline editing – click any bet name, type, click away – BOOM, saved forever
- Delete bets with confidence (only the one you hate disappears)
- Clean, readable, senior-dev-approved code (yes, we extracted that nasty ternary into its own component)
- Built with Vite → starts faster than your bookie can say “you’re cut off”

## Tech Stack (The Cool Kids)

- React 19 + Hooks (only function components, class components are canceled)
- Vite → HMR so fast you’ll think you’re cheating
- Pure JavaScript (TypeScript coming when we feel fancy)
- Zero external libraries – we roll our own like real degens

## How to Run This Bad Boy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/odds-converter-pro.git
cd odds-converter-pro
npm install
npm run dev
